## DONE

### v1.3.0-1 (2022-04-24)

- When the app opens, show Expenses page (instead of Dashboard page)
- Change expense copy action from long press to double click (expected that it will be faster)
- Use UTC+9 internally (to have document id of users in all timezone the same, so when the user switch to another timezone, they can keep updating or deleting the expense)

### v1.2.0 (2022-04-19)

- Click a pie of a chart then show all expenses in the month relating to the pie (wasted, nice, basic)
